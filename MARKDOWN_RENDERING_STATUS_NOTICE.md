# Markdown Rendering Status Notice (Best-Effort)

Last updated: 2026-01-13

## Why this notice exists

This repository includes **multiple formats** for the same week’s notes:

- **DOCX**: editable source documents intended for best accessibility formatting (e.g., Word or a compatible editor).
- **PDF**: offline/print-friendly version with faithful layout.
- **Markdown (MD)**: a **best-effort** conversion for GitHub in-browser reading and search.

## Important accessibility note

The Markdown pages are **not guaranteed to preserve the dyslexia-friendly formatting** of the original DOCX/PDF.

Markdown is intentionally simple; it cannot represent all Word layout features (exact spacing, columns, text boxes, page headers/footers, etc.).

If you need the highest-fidelity dyslexia-friendly formatting:

- Prefer the **PDF** for reading.
- Prefer the **DOCX** for editing.

Markdown should be treated as:

- a **searchable companion**
- a **web-friendly preview**
- a **fallback** when viewing PDFs/DOCXs is inconvenient

## Where to find the “authoritative” versions

Within each course/week folder under `notes/`, look for:

- `*.pdf` (offline/fidelity)
- `docx/*.docx` (editable/fidelity)

If a Markdown version exists, it will be located alongside the source document (example: `my_notes.docx` -> `my_notes.md`).
