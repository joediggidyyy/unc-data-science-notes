<td><p>I usually assume that services, such as Rocket Money, are a scam or a data collection effort. But when AJ and Hecklefish tell me that something is ok, for some reason that carries weight. I was still on the fence but struggling to think of a candidate for this assignment, I decided to give it a try. The questions they asked through the registration were expected and not notable. Name, email, reason for interest, how did you hear of us; standard stuff. The terms of service were interesting. All the expected jargon concerning personal information handling, legal disclaimers, etc. The first of the notable items to catch my attention was the disclaimer stating that Rocket Money is not a financial professional. This coupled with the verbiage and $500 cap of the liability disclaimer were enough to give me pause, but I decided to push on. Something else that I found interesting was the additional ten-point section applicable only to those who download the mobile application onto an Apple device usurping the service providers’ intellectual property rights and naming themselves as a third-party beneficiary to the agreement.</p>
<p>Despite the one or two potentially eyebrow-raising items in the Rocket Money terms of service, I know that their level of culpability as described in this agreement in the event of client damages would not hold up in court. I do not see that there is unreasonable risk or obvious surface for discrimination. The service does restrict users to those with checking accounts and/or credit cards, which is potentially limiting access along a socio-economic ridge. The inherent nature of the service makes it difficult to cater to those without the ability to interface electronically with their financial institutions effectively limiting service to those with internet access, creating a divide along both socio-economic and geographical boundaries. I do not see that either of these omission signify intentional discrimination by the company as the very nature of the service does not imply a latent demand by the disaffected sectors, though I am making that judgement without adequate data and a confident answer would require substantial evidence gathering and analysis.</p></td>
