# Style Guide

This guide keeps the repository consistent and easy to scan.

## File naming

- Use `Week01`, `Week02`, … (zero-padded)
- Use kebab-case for note pages:
  - `01-introduction.md`
  - `02-key-terms.md`

## Page template

Recommended top-of-page structure:

1. Title
2. What you’ll learn (3–7 bullets)
3. Key terms (bullets + short definitions)
4. Main content (sections)
5. Worked examples (if relevant)
6. Quick check / summary

## Voice

- Write in plain language.
- Prefer active voice.
- Define terms before using them heavily.

## Code blocks (when unavoidable)

- Keep code short.
- Add commentary *above* the code block in bullets.
- Avoid long unbroken code dumps.

## Citations

- If you rely on a source, add a short “References” section at the bottom.
- Use links rather than copying large excerpts.
