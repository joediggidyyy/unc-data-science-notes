# Security Policy

This is a content repository. Security issues are uncommon, but if you find something risky (malicious links, phishing, etc.), please report it.

## Reporting a security issue

- Open an issue if it’s not sensitive.
- If it *is* sensitive (e.g., a malicious link), contact the maintainer privately (see `SUPPORT.md`).

## Responsible disclosure

If you find a security issue, please report it responsibly. Do not share it publicly until it has been addressed.

## Response

The maintainer will remove or fix harmful content as quickly as practical.

> CodeSentinel is used to automatically scan for potential security issues. If you find a false positive, please report it to the maintainer so it can be reviewed and, if necessary, added to the approved artifacts manifest.
