The `docs/` tree contains reader-facing help for this repository (how to view notes, dashboards, quick starts).

## Editing rules

- Keep docs consistent with the actual workflow: `python maintain.py` and `python maintain.py --strict`.
- Avoid adding or embedding sensitive content (PII) or prohibited course materials.
- Prefer small diffs; keep navigation files (`notes/INDEX.md`) generated by tooling.

## Machine-readable sidecar policy (.md + .json)

- This file has a sibling `docs/guides/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.json` that must remain in sync.
- `checksum` in the JSON is SHA-256 of this Markdown (CRLF normalized to LF).
