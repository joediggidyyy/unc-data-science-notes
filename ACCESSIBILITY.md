# Accessibility Guidelines (Dyslexia-Friendly)

These standards aim to make the notes easier to read for people with dyslexia and for tired brains in general.

## Layout

- Prefer **short lines** and **short paragraphs**.
- Use whitespace: one blank line between paragraphs.
- Use headings to chunk content.

## Emphasis and typography

- Avoid italics for emphasis; use **bold** sparingly.
- Avoid ALL CAPS except short labels.
- Prefer plain language.

## Structure

- Start each page with a short “What you’ll learn” list.
- End with a short “Quick check” or summary.
- Use consistent section ordering across weeks.

## Lists

- Use bullets for properties, steps, and checklists.
- Keep list items short.

## Images and diagrams

- Every image should have a caption and context.
- Prefer simple diagrams with high contrast.
- If you include screenshots, crop to the relevant region.

## Links

- Link text should be descriptive (avoid “click here”).
- Prefer stable links (official docs, DOI, course page).

## Math and symbols

- Define symbols before using them.
- Keep notation consistent.
- Provide a short “translation” in plain language.
