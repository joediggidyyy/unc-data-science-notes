# Local-only instruction notes (template)

This file is a **template** for local/private instruction notes.

## Where to put the real file

Create a local-only copy at:

- `local_untracked/instructions/LOCAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

That folder is ignored by git (see `.gitignore`) and should **never** be committed.

## What belongs in local-only notes

- Private/internal links
- Local paths, machine-specific setup
- Personal reminders
- Draft procedures that are not ready for public sharing

## What must *never* be committed

- Secrets / API keys / tokens
- Personal identifying information (PII)
- Private logs or screenshots
- Non-public course materials or solutions
